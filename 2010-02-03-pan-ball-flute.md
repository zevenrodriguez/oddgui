# Pan-Ball Flute


The Pan-Ball Flute is a hand crank device the pulls back a pinball style lever. Once the lever is let go a magnet advances passing through the coils and hitting a piezo. The crank has crowbar style forks that pull back the lever. The intention is that with combination of generators my hope is to power some piezo buzzers
