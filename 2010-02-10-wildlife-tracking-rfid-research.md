# Wildlife Tracking: RFID research


So I was interested in RFID for tracking monkeys. RFID comes in two flavors: passive and active. For tracking monkeys the preferable would be an active RFID chip.
`**Active vs Passive**`

`****Active  
 Power: Battery powered, average 7000 hrs **depending onÂ receiver*  
 Signal Strength needed: Low Signal  
 Range: up to 100m  
 Data Storage: 128kb read/write search and access to data
``
Passive  
 Power: comes from RF reader  
 Signal Strength needed: High signal

Range: 3-5m or less

Data Storage: 128 bytes of read/write

Depending on models active RFID could have high operating temperature, between -35c and 50c. This is important for the highÂ temperaturesÂ in the amazon. Another advantage is the size andÂ weight. Ranging around 14 grams and 2.4 in x 1.2 in x 0.4 in to big ones that are around 2in x 3in x 0.5 in
