# Collager

CollagerÂ is a screen based interactive table that lets you compose collages from images you take from your surroundings and then stamp on the screen. Â It is designed by Zeven Rodriguez and Matt Swenson for the kids at the NYU Langone Medical Center: The Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine Pediatric Department.

The system works in 2 parts: the controller and the the over head camera. The controller has a camera inside and a IR light. The controllers camera is used to take pictures of your surroundings. The IR light inside the ball is used to position and stamp the image on to the screen.
