# HungryTime

<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">An idea for the floor I have been looking at making is a system of alerting people on the floor when someone is hungry. The project is called HungryTime. The idea has 2 aspects to it. A physical notification display and a way to communicate with that display. In its current inception, a mobile app and an arduino based projection system are they ways to carry out the project. The mobile app is suposed extremly simple. It has 2 buttons, one to say your hungry and one to tell you are out to lunch. It also has a counter to tell you how many people are hungry. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The simple design for the mobile app does not let you see who is hungry. By using text messaging, it solves that issue. Using the cell number and pre-registering the userâ€™s name. When using text messaging option either the number of hungry or the names those who are hungry would be displayed in the message. It would be depend on message length.</span></span>
