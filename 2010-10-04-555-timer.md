# 555 Timer

Allison and I used this [schematic](http://wild-bohemian.com/electronics/flasher.html) to blink some lights with a 555 timer. We found out somethings about this circuit. 1. matching the resistors coming off pin 7 and 8 help you even out the blink rate. Also because the 555 timer output makes the voltage change from + to – so Â can get the lights the blink at the same time if you orient them the same way.
