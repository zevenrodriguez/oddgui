# Final Project(or) tests

For our final project for Greenfab, we are making a light graffiti√Ç project. We are looking to use cardboard boxes or tubes, 10mm led, a blinking circuit, and a nocturnal circuit to power the whole thing. Allison and I looked at how to do a projection system easily. We used a small cardboard box with a hole.

We initially tried 3 lights.

We then used the circle we cut out as a model for our stencil.

We found that one light was better then 3 lights. The LED operate well at 3.5v and 120mA.

We found some round cardboard tube and found that we can get a longer projection.
