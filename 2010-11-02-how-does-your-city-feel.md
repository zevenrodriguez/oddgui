<div>**[How Does Your City Feel?](http://itp.nyu.edu/~cw1028/understandingnetworks/feelingcities.php)** captures the emotions people feel in their cities by measuring them in the contents of local real-time Twitter messages.</div><div>What are people feeling in New York City? Seattle? San Francisco? Sad? Happy? Angry? Love?</div><div>When you visit, please choose a city and click an emotion to see the results. If you click only on the city, you will see a graph of the emotions measured by the statement, âI feelâ¦â The mapping is created instantly via Google Charts API by parsing XML from Twitterâs search results. [How Does Your City Feel](http://itp.nyu.edu/~cw1028/understandingnetworks/feelingcities.php) is coded with Javascript, and AJAX. So far, Iâve been tickled by the different moods each city exhibits. San Francisco appears more relaxed while New York shows more emotional volatility. When New Yorkers feel love, they really express it â same goes for anger! See the screen shots below for more examples.</div><div>[**How Does Your City Feel?**](http://itp.nyu.edu/~cw1028/understandingnetworks/feelingcities.php) was created by [**Cindy Wong**](http://pixelpunchout.com) and**Zeven Rodriguez**.</div><div>[![](http://pixelpunchout.com/content/images/2010/10/nyc.png "nyc")](http://pixelpunchout.com/content/images/2010/10/nyc.png "nyc")</div><div>New York City</div><div>[![](http://pixelpunchout.com/content/images/2010/10/sf.png "sf")](http://pixelpunchout.com/content/images/2010/10/sf.png "sf")</div>[![](http://pixelpunchout.com/content/images/2010/10/sf_love.png "sf_love")](http://pixelpunchout.com/content/images/2010/10/sf_love.png "sf_love")
