The MOMA is redesigning the entrances of there exhibits. The Abstract Expressionist exhibit is a clear example of the new visual style they are going for. They are using large type with high contrasting colors. In this case they flooded 2 walls with this design. I also found it interesting that the automatic doors add this barrier which helps you read the sign when you first get in.

The reorganization of the abstract expressionists had a good flow. The scale of the art and the sparsity makes it overwhelming enough. You still get the wow factor. The designers used the rooms to juxtapose the artists. Rothko and Newman are used as the calm rooms to give viewers a break from the Pollock paintings. One of the main breaks in the flow where the Robert Frank Photos by the staircase and the rest of the photography.

One of the biggest issues I had with the exhibit was the lighting. The lighting felt spotty. I made a weird gradation between the work. It made the art photograph ok, but the light was not enough to light the room evenly.
