# Wildlife/People Observation

We went to Coles gym to observe people playing basketball. Tracking targets that move fast was difficult. The most important part was generating the short hand codes to be able to properly track the subjects. During our exercise, our code evolved to better track the game. An example of that was originally we only had a contact event. We added a grab event because we noticed that their were more times that contact was people trying to go for the ball. Here is all the info I collected
